### In this project:
Every 'tree' has a certain genome that determines the behavior of each cell.
The closer a cell gets to the top of the sketch, it accumulates more sun energy.
When it's time for a tree to die, it's offshoots fall to the ground as new seeds.
There's a small chance of mutation so there's variety of tree and to help natural selection do it's thing :)
